            PROPHECY SAINT FAME is a fashion house that is owned by the
            internet. It is the first of its kind. Nothing like this has existed
            before. Why has nothing like this existed before? Because its
            technological foundations only emerged within the past year.
            Ethereum smart contracts enable and enforce collective decision
            making, allowing anyone in the world to participate—both creatively
            and financially. The organization is open to everyone, and SAINT
            FAME will hold the pooled capital of its disciples. Disciples will
            vote on what to do with that capital. Like any community on the
            internet, SAINT FAME can scale to billions of people. Unlike
            communities on the internet, SAINT FAME can scale to billions in
            capital. It aligns incentives for participants by giving them real
            ownership in their creativity. This collective creation and
            ownership is uniquely enabled by Ethereum, a new stack for
            internet-native economic collaboration that is independent of any
            legal entity or jurisdiction, making it accessible to all. Anyone in
            the world can view, and become a part of the inner workings of SAINT
            FAME. Anyone can observe or potentially become a DISCIPLE who hold
            $AINT. Anyone can create or participate in a vote on what the
            organization should create under its brand. Buy why do any of this?
            To prove that it is possible. If it is possible, then we have shown
            that it is possible for the internet to collectively create—and
            crucially—own culture itself. It stands to take back culture from
            corporations and platforms. The world in which this is possible is
            in fact a new paradigm for global, collective creation. That is what
            SAINT FAME wants to build for. To take part follow us on Twitter,
